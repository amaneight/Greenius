We are proposing "Victoria Green Tranist Strategy" that focuses on optimizing active public infrastructure that can significantly enhance environmental and operational efficiency by promoting carpooling and integrating EV charging facilities. By incentivizing carpooling, state government can reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road, leading to decreased carbon emissions and lower traffic congestion. Additionally, investing in solar-powered infrastructure—such as solar panels on public transit facilities and carpool parking lots—can harness renewable energy to power these amenities, further cutting down on the reliance on fossil fuels. This dual approach not only lessens the environmental footprint but also maximizes the utility of existing infrastructure, ensuring that resources are used more effectively and sustainably.
This strategy has a potential of generating regenerative economy of $15 million in bundled offset securities that can be exchanged for larger purchases or offset. This revenue can be the re-invested back in enhancing and improving active public infrastructure.
